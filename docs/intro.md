# Introduction

<b>roact-error-boundary</b> is a reusable error boundary component library for Roact inspired by react-spring. It makes error logging, reverting states, and displaying fallback components incredibly easy to implement.

## Installation

### Wally

`roact-error-boundary` supports [Roact17](https://github.com/grilme99/CorePackages). However, [Legacy Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact) is not supported. To install, add the latest version of roact-error-boundary to your wally.toml:
